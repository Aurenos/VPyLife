# VPyLife 

A 3D Visual Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

By default the rule of life is '23/3', the environment size is 10, and the life
seed is the current system time. 

Rules are in the notation '{S}/{B}' where {S} is a string containing a list of numbers to determine how many adjacent cells are necessary for a cell to survive, and {B} is a string containing a list of numbers to determine how many adjacent cells are necessary to be born (activate).

The environment size is a single positive integer which determines the volume of the cubic ecosystem. 

Cells show age by changing color slowly from green to brown the longer they remain active.

### Good Parameter Sets

*These are parameters that make for interesting or fun generations.*

**Rule** | **Environment Size** | **Seed** 

- 23/3 | 10 | qpwrighqpew8rgh
- 23/3 | 50 | kile
